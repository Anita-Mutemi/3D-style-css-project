# CSS 3D Box

This is a simple CSS 3D animation of a rotating box with a floor and a ball. 

## Description

The ball,box and floor are created using HTML elements with CSS styles to position them in 3D space and animate the rotation. No JavaScript is required.

## Usage

Open style.html in a modern browser that supports CSS 3D transforms, such as Chrome or Firefox. The box will smoothly rotate 360 degrees indefinitely.

The animation is controlled by the @keyframes rule in styles.css. Adjust the timing and transform values to customize the animation.

The 3D perspective is applied to the parent #scene element. Change the perspective value to adjust the 3D effect.

## Credits

3D transforms and animation powered by CSS. No other libraries or frameworks are used.(https://youtu.be/NdftnCDwKaU?si=aGP9S_TMVfn5K86W)
